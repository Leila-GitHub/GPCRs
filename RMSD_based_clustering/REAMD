RMSD-based clustering for CB1-synthetic cannabinoids simulations

1-	pick_clust.ipynb (picks the number of clusters based on Gap-statistics)	
2-	clustering_cb1_TMs.ipynb (K-means clustering, input "all-to-all RMSD matrix) 
		center of clusters mapped to the original frames of MD simulations for visual inspection using Pymol)
		selected clusters saved and mapped to the original frames for further analysis
3-	clust.sh: sample bash script to run Jupyter notebook from terminal
